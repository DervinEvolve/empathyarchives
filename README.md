## Overview

Empathy Archives is an innovative voice-to-voice interface designed for students and educators to engage in intuitive conversations about history. This project was developed as a submission for Microsoft's Hackathon, leveraging the power of Hume AI's expression detection models to create a more empathetic and responsive learning experience.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**: Engage in natural, spoken conversations about historical topics.
- **Emotion-Aware Responses**: The AI adapts its output based on the user's tone, creating a more personalized interaction.
- **Primary Source Integration**: Access and discuss a vast array of historical primary sources.
- **Real-time Transcription**: View a live transcription of the conversation.
- **Tone Analysis**: Displays the top three detected tones in the user's voice output.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Speak your question or topic of interest related to history.
2. **Voice Analysis**: Hume AI's expression detection models analyze your tone and emotion.
3. **Contextual Search**: The AI searches for relevant primary sources and historical information.
4. **Tailored Response**: Based on the analysis and search results, the AI formulates a response.
5. **Expressive Output**: The response is delivered via voice, with tone and pacing adjusted to match the context.
6. **Visual Feedback**: A transcription appears on screen, highlighting the detected tones.
